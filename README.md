# ZMK firmware for the Nine keyboard

This repo contains firmware for the [Nine keyboard](https://github.com/bsag/nine-nano). If you want to use my version of the keymap, you can go to the Actions tab, find the most recent workflow with a green checkmark and download the firmware zip file. See the Nine keyboard build guide for [instructions on how to flash the firmware](https://github.com/bsag/nine-nano/blob/main/docs/build_guide.md#flashing-firmware). 

If you would like to modify the keymap, you can fork this repository.

#This repo also contains configs for most of my 18 key layout boards on their own branches (probably not the ideal way to do it).
